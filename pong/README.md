# Pong

This is a recreation of Pong, created for two players to play locally. It features sounds from the original game, sourced from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiShX2pTz9A). The ball angle also dynamically changes based on where it hits a paddle (when hitting the top/bottom, it simply inverts its x and y velocities)
