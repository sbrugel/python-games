# Python Games

A few games I made/re-created in Python, using PyGame (primarily).

Some of these games were originally created by Al Sweigart from his _Making Games with Python & Pygame_ book, but were modified by myself in one or more ways (features-wise). The code for those games is distributed/modified under the [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 US](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/) license.

More info for each game in the READMEs of each folder.

- [Pygame Template](https://github.com/sbrugel/python-games/tree/master/template): A very basic app that demonstrates the fundamental aspects of Pygame.
- [Memory Puzzle](https://github.com/sbrugel/python-games/tree/master/memory-puzzle): The player is presented with a 4x4 to 10x10 board of boxes covering icons of different shapes and colors. The player must match all pairs of icons to win. Different difficulty modes, color palettes for icons, and a toggle for limited attempts are available.
