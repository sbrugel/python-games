# Python Games

A few games I made/re-created in Python, using PyGame (primarily).

Some of these games were originally created by Al Sweigart from his _Making Games with Python & Pygame_ book, but were modified by myself in one or more ways (features-wise). The code for those games is distributed/modified under the [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 US](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/) license.

More info for each game in the READMEs of each folder.
