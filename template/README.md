This is just a basic demonstration of PyGame fundamentals, following chapter 2 of Al Sweigart's _Making Games with Python & Pygame_, with various modifications including event listeners. Non-obvious parts of code are commented. It's pretty messy and isn't really a game, but the fundamentals are there.

`cat.png` and `tetrisb.wav` are also by Al Sweigart.

Features:

- Basic window setup
- Management of various event listeners, including exiting, mousedown, keydown, with their properties demonstrated
- Drawing shapes of various kinds with different properties
- Animation/blitting images on screen
- Fonts
- Audio
